Hello, I am Aminullah Taj Muhammad from Pakistan. I am currently lived in Karachi.
I’m a programmer by choice. I have work experience with languages like C++, Java. 
I am basically C++ programming, Web Designer, Android Develepor developed many project 
and applications for learning. I am currently doing Android Application Development 
with Kotlin. I am also a writer wrote articles about my life experience and my professional 
experience on [Medium](https://medium.com/). Medium is a writing platform where peoples share their experiences. 

I am very passionate about the open source community where programmers share their experience
and make thing easy for beginners and for experts. I also contribute programming experience on 
[Github](http://github.com). Github is a platform for programmers where programmers share their 
code for the public. Github is very addicted. I am very excited and feel happy to share my code 
on GitHub and helps beginners. I recently contribute on the hactoberfest challenge where I contribute 
5 contributions on GitHub and get T-Shirts and stickers from 
[Github](http://github.com), [Hacktoberfest ](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)and [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). 
I suppose it’s a kind of support from GitHub. Here is a picture of hactoberfest T-shirt and Stickers.
