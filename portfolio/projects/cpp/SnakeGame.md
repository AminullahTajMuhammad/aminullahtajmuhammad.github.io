A Snake Game with AI tic tac toe game in with console graphics in c++

It was my second game when I was in 2nd Semester. It was challlenging game because of AI(Artifical Intelligence). I used mathematics for AI. Use simple distance farmula to calculate its coordinates. It whole game functionality works on X,Y values that get from ```gotoxy()``` method. I used Object Oritention Programming in this game. It is a open source project.

In this game I used many features like X,Y coordinates and used colors on the console screen used windows library ```#include<windows.h>```.
